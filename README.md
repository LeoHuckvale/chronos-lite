    - [ ] Feature development
        - [ ] Battery can charge from a market
        - [ ] Battery can discharge to a market
        - [ ] Battery commits capacity to entire market time interval
        - [ ] Battery pays for charging
        - [ ] Battery is paid for discharging
            - For example, if the battery chose to commit 5 MW of discharging into Market 1 when the market price is
                50 Â£/MWh, it would be paid Â£125 (5 MW * 0.5h * 50 Â£/MWh).
        - [ ] Battery can export any amount of power up to its maximum discharge rate for any duration
        - [ ] Battery cannot discharge beyond stored energy
        - [ ] Battery can import any amount power up to maximum charge rate for any duration
        - [ ] Battery cannot charge beyond storage capacity
        - [ ] Battery cannot sell same unit of energy to both markets
        - [ ] Battery can divide power across both markets
            - For example, a battery with a 5 MW maximum discharge rate and 5 MWh of energy stored
                could commit 2 MW of discharge into Market 1 for two half-hour intervals, and 3 MW of
                discharge into Market 2 for its 1 hour interval, but it could not commit 5 MW to both markets at
                the same time, and could not discharge more than 5 MWh of energy over that interval
        - [ ] Battery cannot charge and discharge at the same time
