,Values,Units,Description
Max charging rate,1,MW,The maximum power that the battery can import from the grid
Max discharging rate,2,MW,The maximum power that the battery can export to the grid
Max storage volume,3,MWh,Maximum volume of energy that the battery can store
Battery charging efficiency,0.04,-,Fraction of energy imported from grid that is lost prior to storage in the battery
Battery discharging efficiency,0.05,-,Fraction of energy exported from the battery that is lost prior to reaching the grid
Lifetime (1),6,years,Maximum battery lifetime in years
Lifetime (2),7000,cycles,"Maximum battery lifetime in battery cycles equivalent - one cycle is defined as charging up to max storage volume and then discharging all stored energy. This does not have to be done in one go - e.g. charging up to 75%, discharging to 0%, then charging up to 25% and discharging to 0% still counts as one cycle."
Storage volume degradation rate,0.008,%/cycle,"Percentage loss of storage volume per battery cycle (note: in %, not as a fraction)"
Capex,900000,£,Cost of purchasing and installing the battery
Fixed Operational Costs,10000,£/year,Annual overhead costs for operating the battery in electricity markets
